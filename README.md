# Creating an Online CV with HTML and CSS

In this project, we create an online CV across several phases. First, we build the HTML structure using semantic tags for headings, lists, and content organization. Then, we style the layout, typography, and colors with responsive design for different screen sizes. 

Next, we populate the CV with personal details, work history, education, skills, and projects. Finally, we add interactive forms to collect visitor information. This project provides practical experience in fundamental web development while creating a professional online resume.
